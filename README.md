Features: 46 (numeric and non-numeric)

These are the research questions:

## RQ#1: 
Uncovering Hidden Patterns in US Accident Data: By analyzing a vast dataset of US accidents spanning multiple years, this research aims to uncover hidden patterns and correlations among various accident attributes. The findings can provide valuable insights into the underlying causes and factors contributing to accidents.

## RQ#2: 
Identifying High-Risk Areas for Accidents: Through a comprehensive analysis of the US accident data, this research aims to identify high-risk areas prone to accidents. By considering factors such as accident frequency, severity, and location characteristics, the study can help in identifying specific regions that require targeted safety interventions.

## RQ#3:
Exploring the Impact of Road Features on Accident Severity: By examining the relationship between road features (e.g., crossings, junctions, roundabouts) and accident severity, this research seeks to understand how different road infrastructures contribute to the severity of accidents. The findings can guide urban planners and policymakers in designing safer road networks.

## RQ#4:
Investigating the Influence of Time of Day on Accident Occurrence: This research focuses on analyzing the US accident data to determine if there are specific time periods during the day when accidents are more likely to occur. By studying the temporal patterns, the research aims to provide insights for effective traffic management and accident prevention strategies.

## RQ#5: 
Assessing the Relationship between Weather Conditions and Accident Characteristics: By examining the relationship between weather conditions (temperature, precipitation, visibility, etc.) and accident characteristics (severity, type), this research aims to understand how different weather factors impact accidents. The findings can contribute to the development of weather-responsive traffic management systems and safety protocols.
